# Hospital-management
An C++ application for Data Structure and Algorithms Course

In a hospital there are some patients and each of them suffers by one or more diseases. 
Each patient is identified by their Personal Identification Code. 
The hospital needs an application to manage their patients together with their diseases. 
The application should allow to:
	Add a patient together with their disease
	Remove a patient’s disease when he is does not suffer by that disease anymore
	Display all the patient’s diseases

I made this application using as ADT multimap implementation on a hash table, collision resolution by open adressing.
